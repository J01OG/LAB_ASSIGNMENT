tips(for a fresh start)
:Go through the ppts try to understand the concepts through reading the ppts and also try to understand the sample questions in the ppts\n
:pls dont go through any ppts or program if you dont feel like it\n
:try to solve all the given question after you read the ppt 
:download the answers only if you have given the question atleast 12h 
:if solving the given question is enough for you should always search more question
:if you search any question on youtube there is an explanation on the question if you do not understand the question pls go through the vidio then only continew
:if the program makes you stress enjoy it


when do you know you can continew to the next topic\n
:the key point to know here is every next topic would use what you have studed before the topic so if you want to go to the next topic 
 keep in mind :you must have complete knowledge of what you had studed and if anyone would give any question you should be in the position to solve it
 let it be the hardest question of the topic ,if you have this much confidence you may go to the next topic 
 

these are all the code i got in collage if you want to add more or you can mail me @ 2106118@kiit.ac.in with the question

 in a unique way (except for the order). These are called prime factors of a
 number. In other words, In number theory, the prime factors of a positive
 integer are the prime numbers that divide that integer exactly, without 
 leaving a remainder. The process of finding these numbers is called integer
 factorization, or prime factorization. 
 • Enter a number : 100
 • The prime factors of 100 are 2(2) and 5(2)
